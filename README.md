# covid

This repo has a couple notebooks with my analysis of COVID data.

At this point, the main notebook for public consumption is
`cdc_data_calcs.ipynb`, which is entirely based on the excellent
data put out by the CDC. That replaced tons of logic that was used
throughout much of the pandemic to correct anomalies in data.
